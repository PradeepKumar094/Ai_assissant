# AI-Powered Interview Assistant - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We've successfully implemented a React application that serves as an AI-powered interview assistant with the following key components:

## Core Features Implemented

### 1. Dual Tab Interface
- **Interviewee Tab**: For candidates to go through the interview process
- **Interviewer Tab**: For interviewers to manage and review candidates
- Both tabs are synchronized using Redux state management

### 2. Resume Processing
- PDF and DOCX resume upload functionality
- Basic parsing to extract Name, Email, and Phone
- Form prefilling with extracted data
- Validation for missing fields

### 3. Interview Flow
- 6-question interview process (2 Easy, 2 Medium, 2 Hard)
- Timed questions with auto-submission:
  - Easy: 20 seconds
  - Medium: 60 seconds
  - Hard: 120 seconds
- Progress tracking and visualization
- Pause/Resume functionality

### 4. Candidate Management
- Candidate dashboard with sorting by score
- Search and filter capabilities
- Detailed candidate view with interview history
- Interview restart functionality

### 5. Data Persistence
- Local storage of all interview data using Redux Persist
- Welcome Back modal for unfinished sessions
- Complete state restoration on page reload

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
- Redux Toolkit for global state management
- Redux Persist for automatic local storage synchronization
- Slice-based architecture for candidate data

### UI Components
- Ant Design for professional UI components
- Responsive layout with proper spacing and styling
- Interactive elements with appropriate feedback

### Data Flow
- Unidirectional data flow through Redux
- Component-level state for temporary UI states
- Proper separation of concerns between components

## Key Components

1. **IntervieweeTab.jsx**: Handles resume upload and candidate onboarding
2. **InterviewChat.jsx**: Manages the interview process and timing
3. **InterviewerTab.jsx**: Provides dashboard view of all candidates
4. **CandidateDetailView.jsx**: Shows detailed interview history
5. **candidatesSlice.js**: Manages candidate state and persistence
6. **resumeParser.js**: Basic resume parsing functionality

## Future Enhancements

### AI Integration
- Integration with Gemini API for:
  - Dynamic question generation based on role and experience
  - Intelligent answer evaluation and scoring
  - Detailed candidate feedback and improvement suggestions

### Advanced Features
- Video interview capabilities
- Code snippet evaluation for technical questions
- Multi-language support
- Export functionality for reports
- Email notifications
- Role-based access control

### Technical Improvements
- Enhanced resume parsing with proper PDF/DOCX libraries
- Improved UI/UX with animations and transitions
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Unit and integration testing
- Performance optimization

## How to Run the Application

1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the application at `http://localhost:5173`
